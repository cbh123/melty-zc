The Challey Institute for Global Innovation and Growth is highlighting the impact of our faculty and students at NDSU and in the community. This month, we are shining a spotlight on Zia Muhammad. 
 Challey Spotlight: Zia Muhammad 
 Graduate student, Computer Science 
 Zia Muhammad is a first-year Ph.D. student studying computer science at NDSU. He grew up in Islamabad, Pakistan, where he completed his master’s degree in information security at the National University of Science and Technology and taught cybersecurity at Air University. He previously worked as a researcher at the National Cyber Security Auditing and Evaluation Lab in Pakistan. In August 2022, he came to the United States to pursue his doctoral studies at NDSU. As a Mancur Olson Graduate Fellow, he will engage with the ideas of the Challey Institute and participate in a graduate student reading group on “An Introduction to Public Choice.”
 What inspired you to go to graduate school, and why did you choose NDSU?  
It was my dream to do a Ph.D. and dedicate all my time and efforts to global research and innovation, specifically in computer science. During my master’s, I decided to study at an international institution to gain exposure and cultural diversity. So, I started looking for Ph.D. institutions that are globally recognized, and that is how I found North Dakota State University. It is a top research institution in computer science. People from all around the world come here to study, and there are a lot of career opportunities for students as research and teaching assistants. 
 Your advisor is Challey Scholar Dr. Zahid Anwar. What research topics are the two of you currently working on?  
I have been working with Dr. Zahid. It has been a great working experience, and he is really an expert adviser. When we talk about cybersecurity, he is an IT geek who is dedicated and a field expert. There is always something to learn in every meeting. He is the best mentor because he takes you step-by-step and guides you through the research process. We just started to explore different domains. Currently, we are working on the security challenges facing autonomous vehicles and electric vehicles. We are also exploring mobile security and the impact of various public policies on society.
 What does the Mancur Olson Graduate Fellowship mean to you? How will it help you pursue your career goals? 
First of all, I am very happy to receive this fellowship, and I would like to thank the Challey Institute for making this effort. It means a lot. My main focus as a teacher was to work for the betterment of society. So, after pursuing my Ph.D., I want to serve my community, teach, produce valuable research, and work for the betterment of global institutions. I would love to help meet the goals of the Challey Institute and make this world a better place. 
 The Challey Institute hosts many prominent speakers. You recently had an opportunity to meet with Sam Peltzman, a distinguished economist from the University of Chicago. What did you learn from Dr. Peltzman? How did his visit enhance your NDSU experience?  
This initiative [Distinguished Speaker Series] is so good for students and the institution. It was a great opportunity to meet Sam Peltzman, a renowned researcher and a great person. He has worked on smart transportation—so after I learned that, I was very interested to talk to him. His ideas provided a multi-dimensional perspective that will be helpful in my research. It was really fun, and these initiatives encourage and motivate students.
 How does funding like the Mancur Olson Graduate Fellowship support you in pursuing your dream at NDSU?  
The fellowship provides financial support, learning opportunities, and networking possibilities. We all know that living in the U.S. is expensive. As an international student, you face multiple financial issues, especially in your first year. You have to pay for things like accommodations, utilities, and insurance. That’s why these initiatives really help students. These kinds of partnerships give you an initial boost so you can be on track, focused, and motivated to do great work. 
The Sheila and Robert Challey Institute for Global Innovation and Growth aims to advance understanding in the areas of innovation, trade, institutions, and human potential to identify policies and solutions for the betterment of society. Learn more at www.ndsu.edu/challeyinstitute

# Difference-makers: Itedal Shalabi and Nareman Taha. South suburban women help link Arab Americans to social services

As the children of immigrants, Itedal Shalabi and Nareman Taha have spent their lives straddling the line between two worlds. Born in the Middle East, but raised mostly in the United States, Shalabi and Taha have made a career out of bridging the cultural gap between East and West, Arab and American, traditional and modern. The women, who run an Arab American social service agency in the southwest suburbs, help clients navigate our country’s complex benefits system, which can be confusing even for native English speakers familiar with American institutions and culture. “The Eastern part of the world is about ‘my family.’ I am the last person to worry about what I want. I put my parents, my siblings, my husband, my kids all ahead of me,” said Taha, a 42-year-old Palos Park resident of Palestinian descent. “Now you’re coming to the West, I’m putting myself first and everybody behind me. How do you bring both worlds together?” Shalabi, 50, of Bridgeview, and Taha founded Arab American Family Services in early 2001, shortly after getting to know one another while working for a behavioral health company they felt was doing a disservice to the Arab community. “They weren’t really invested in the community,” Taha said. “It was, for them, a moneymaking business that we said ‘we didn’t want anything to do with this.’ But we did want the service and the love and the pride and the passion, so we said … ‘let’s just start our own business.’ “(Our parents) didn’t have an agency like ours to come in and say ‘how do I navigate through the system?’” Shalabi said. Seventeen years after its founding, Arab American Family Services serves nearly 13,000 families throughout the Chicagoland area and employs more than 30 staff members. In addition to helping connect families with benefits and services, the organization offers programming in areas like domestic violence, mental health, immigration and elder care. The female-led agency’s ascent has faced some push back from more conservative elements within the Arab community that haven’t always been comfortable with women holding leadership positions. “We told the men we want a seat at the table, they didn’t know what the heck to do with us. They still don’t know what to do with us,” Shalabi said. “We’re strong women and we’re independent and we want to make a difference in our community, too.” She said that, from the beginning, the agency hasn’t wavered in doing what it believes is in the best interest of the community and future generations of Arab Americans, even if it has meant bringing issues like domestic violence, child abuse and mental health to the forefront. “It’s always like we were coming at issues that, while everybody wanted to sweep it under the carpet, we were sweeping it right back into the mainstream,” Shalabi said.

Being able to approach their clients’ issues from a place of understanding has enabled the women to bridge the chasm that can exist between Arab and American cultures, they said. In one recent instance, after the agency placed a “promiscuous” woman in a domestic violence shelter because she feared what her father would do to her, the man came seeking information about his daughter’s whereabouts. While Shalabi said she refused to reveal the daughter’s location, she understood the father’s perspective and treated him as a concerned parent and not an offender. “Those are the kinds of things where mainstream says you shouldn’t talk to a perpetrator, but we don’t look at him as a perpetrator in that stand, (but as) someone who’s a victim of his own culture and his own lack of knowledge and his own view of ‘how could my daughter do this,’” she said. Shalabi’s introduction to social work arose out of a situation where traditional Arab culture collided with the American legal system. After high school, she’d been living in an apartment building where, as one of the only English speakers, she served as a translator for many of the other tenants. When the Department of Children and Family Services removed the son of one of her neighbors after the woman burned the boy with a heated spatula, Shalabi got involved, attending meetings between the woman and the agency. “I ended up going with her to a lot of these sessions and a lot of these trainings,” she said. “Everybody would say, ‘Are you her social worker?’ I’m like, ‘What the hell is a social worker?’”    Daily Southtown   Twice-weekly News updates from the south suburbs delivered every Monday and Wednesday  The experience moved her to enroll in college, where, in between raising three boys, she studied social work and eventually graduated from the University of Illinois at Chicago.

After finishing school, her best friend — who happened to be Shalabi’s cousin — put the women in contact. A short time later, they launched Arab American Family Services with the goal of giving community members a place to get culturally-sensitive social assistance. Shalabi credits her and her partner’s embrace of client-centered care — which she said can be difficult for some culturally conservative Arabs to accept and understand — with their upbringings. “Both of us have open-minded fathers,” she said. The women also take pride in knowing that community members view them as strong female role models, Taha said. “So many people will come and say, ‘I tell my daughters to look to you two,’” she said. “People look to us as the model of Arab, Muslim women who have really built something for the community and who carry our identity, our culture, our faith with such pride and respect.” ||||I|||| Advertisement

Rita Biagioli
Associate Director, Behavioral Insights Initiative
University of Chicago Booth School of Business
I use mixed methods research to explore the different
ways in which people with different backgrounds and in
different socio-cultural contexts experience and engage
with the world. In my current role working with the
University of Chicago Diversity & Inclusion Initiative and
the Harry L. Davis Center for Leadership in Booth, I think
about how we can translate behavioral science research
into actionable insights in order to engineer beneficial
experiences. I recently received my PhD in the
Department of Comparative Human Development at the
University of Chicago in psychological anthropology and
cultural psychology. I've done extensive fieldwork in India,
and have additionally worked on research projects for
corporate clients.
Selected Findings from Past Work
I've previously explored the effects of 1) where someone grew up and 2) immigration on the
ways in which those individuals formulate overarching schemas and worldviews, particularly
in relation to the physical world. More specifically, looking at four groups- Hindus in Kolkata
and their adult children, and Hindus from Kolkata but living in the NYC area and their adult
children- I concluded that, for these groups, an understanding of physical world as relational
was important and potentially necessary for understanding divinity as physical. I then teased
out circumstances under individuals came to have this worldview or not to have it.
In line with work I've done on experiential education, I'm currently working on a project that
investigates the affects of teaching behavioral science concepts in an interactive workshop
format on inclusion, both as it is individually internalized and demonstrated as well as how it
might become an expected group norm within groups that experienced the workshop
together.

Iris Bohnet
Professor of Public Policy
Director, Women and Public Policy Program
Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University
A behavioral economist, I combine insights from
economics and psychology to improve decision-making in
organizations and society, often with a gender or crosscultural perspective. My most recent research examines
behavioral design to de-bias how we live, learn and work.
My book, What Works: Gender Equality By Design
(Harvard University Press 2016) provides scientific
insights on how to redesign organizations, school and
society to level the playing field for all.
Selected Findings from Past Work
Gender equality is a moral and a business imperative. But unconscious bias holds us back, and debiasing people’s minds has proven to be difficult and expensive. Diversity training programs have had
limited success, and individual effort alone often invites backlash. Behavioral design offers a new
solution. By de-biasing organizations instead of individuals, we can make smart changes that have big
impacts. Presenting research-based solutions, What Works aims to hand decision-makers the tools
they need to move the needle in classrooms and boardrooms, in hiring and promotion, benefiting
businesses, governments, and the lives of millions.
What Works is built on new insights into the human mind. It draws on data collected by
companies, universities, and governments in Australia, India, Norway, the United Kingdom,
the United States, Zambia, and other countries, often in randomized controlled trials. It points
out dozens of evidence-based interventions that could be adopted right now and
demonstrates how research is addressing gender bias, improving lives and performance.
What Works shows what more can be done—often at shockingly low cost and surprisingly
high speed.
Here is a link to a short (3 min.) video summarizing our work:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niH9wfKsUIc
The Women and Public Policy Program and its affiliated faculty currently run about a dozen
studies on de-biasing organizational practices and procedures, ranging from diagnosing the
causes of gender gaps in recruitment to de-biasing job advertisements to blind evaluation
procedures in hiring to development initiatives, performance appraisals, more structured
promotion processes and inclusive work environments.

C. Monica Capra
Professor of Economic Sciences
Claremont Graduate University
My research crosses disciplinary boundaries. I have
collaborated with psychologists, data scientists, and
neuroscientists to better understand and predict individual
and group choices in the lab and in the field. I am primarily
interested in utilizing novel tools and methods and in
measuring decision processes with a variety of
applications. I am interested in the role of personality on
risk and social preferences and in the role of time
perception in influencing inter-temporal choice. I study
diverse subject pools including adolescents, immigrants,
women entrepreneurs, and households affected by
violence.
Selected Findings from Past Work
Adolescents:
• Results from our fMRI studies suggest that peer effects are mediated by the drive to
avoid the pain from being different, and that risky behaviors in adolescence are
correlated with white matter maturity
Entrepreneurs:
• We found that personality traits of entrepreneurs enrolled in executive programs influence
their decision to open a business.
• - We found evidence that, unlike men, women entrepreneurs exhibited no loss aversion, which
we consider a measure of resilience.
Female volunteers:
• In an ongoing theoretical and laboratory study on volunteering we find that warm-glow
strongly influences time donations.
• - We are collaborating with an international network of women entrepreneurs to study
the effects of mentorship on their sense of wellbeing.
Immigrants:
• In an ongoing study with mobile clinic patients in Southern California, we find evidence
that exposure to adverse childhood experiences affects patients' response to text
message interventions.

Civil (Hydraulic) Engineer 
 Dhaka, Bangladesh
 Montréal, Canada
Decision analysis framework for high inflow events for small hydropower reservoir systems. 
2010 
What are your main responsibilities or activities in your current position? 
Computer modeling (writing) and optimization of surface water (HecRas-1D, River-2D, Flow-3D) for hydrologic and hydraulic studies
Large-scale, multi-discipline, multi-year construction projects, applying project management methodology
Project proposal and technical report writing
Scientific analysis and design preparation of feasibility studies for clients
How does your current work relate to your graduate degree? 
I did my postgraduate degree in Civil Engineering at UBC with a specialization in Hydrotechnical Engineering. For the degree, I had to do research work, the outcome of which was my thesis for BC Hydro - one of the biggest public utility companies in Canada in the sector of hydropower. My research was funded by a collaboration between BC Hydro and UBC, so it was mandatory for me to work 2-3 days a week in BC Hydro’s Edmonds office on non-research work. Because I had just arrived in Canada, I had very few experiences working in my field of industry. Course work at UBC and the professional environment at BC Hydro helped me learn how to correlate my educational background with a professional and highly technical setting and to grow my confidence for the future.
What do you like and what do you find challenging about your current position? 
My job is always full of new challenges, and it is getting more complicated day by day with new complications arising from climate change.
Is your current career path as you originally intended? 
This has been my dream job since my childhood due to the challenges and conditions in Bangladesh regarding water.
What motivated you to pursue graduate work at UBC? 
After completing my undergrad I worked for a year in a private firm. At that time, I realized that my knowledge as an engineer was not robust enough to solve real life problems. The main cause of it was my research deficiency. So I decided to pursue a research-based graduate degree. Also the weather of Vancouver and the multicultural setup of the city attracted me.
What did you enjoy the most about your time as a graduate student at UBC? 
Multiculturalism, teachers, events, the campus (best in Canada).
What key things did you do, or what attitudes or approaches did you have, that contributed to your success? 
Staying positive, persistence, and being truthful and a perfectionist to a point.
What is your best piece of advice for current graduate students preparing for their future careers? 
Always be positive and keep networking.
How are jobs normally posted and filled in your organization or industry? 
Through career websites and references.

# WATCH: Nust director applies genetics to farming

**Score:** 0.12579111754894257
**Author:** Webdev - Fintech web projects
**Published:** 2021-05-25T00:00:00.000Z
**URL:** https://www.chronicle.co.zw/watch-nust-director-applies-genetics-to-farming/

Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter 
MOST people know him as the director of the National University of Science and Technology’s (Nust) Applied Genetics Testing Centre involved in DNA testing.
Mr Zephaniah Dhlamini was among the frontline workers in Bulawayo leading the city’s Covid-19 tests in April last year when the country started grappling with the deadly pandemic.
Unbeknown to many Mr Dhlamini (49) is not just a laboratory scientist, who is always wearing “white lab coats.” He is an avid farmer getting dirty on the land and is making money from the soil.
He is part of a three-man farming venture operating under the name Esidakeni Farm in Umguza on the outskirts of Bulawayo and employs 45 full time workers.
During the harvesting period, they contract part time workers to assist and the numbers can exceed 100 people.
Mr Dhlamini is co-director of the farm together with Mr Charles Moyo and Mr Siphosami Malunga.
    Esidakeni workers load crates of harvested tomatoes  
They are involved in commercial horticulture farming inclusive of tomatoes, onions, beetroot, cabbages and butternut.
Mr Dhlamini on Sunday took a Chronicle news crew on a tour of the farm explaining how employing science is enhancing agriculture.
He said his knowledge of genetics has given them a competitive edge over other farmers producing crops when everyone least expects them to do so.
“Our strategy in doing these projects is to produce most of our products off season when most of the farmers are not producing so as to have an advantage at the market in terms of prices. When the supply is low, we tend to get good prices as you have probably seen we had over two hectares of cabbages which we planted during the rainy season where most people don’t plant. We had a lot of rain during this past season, you get a lot of diseases in cabbages such as black rot, diamondback moth which can destroy your entire crop,” said Mr Dhlamini.
 
“So, what we do is to look for genetics that have varieties which are resistant to the diseases and adverse conditions that you may be facing in that particular season. So, you have to invest in pest control, disease control just to improve your management and improve the crop yield during that season.”
He said through employing science they are able to grow butternut to close the gap that usually exists between June to November when the country would be having a short supply of the product.
“Also, from August to October there is a shortage of tomatoes, we come in because we have an area in the farm which is elevated and it is frost free, we have tested it over the years. This year we are growing six hectares of tomatoes during winter and these mature starting August up to November,” he said.
Mr Dhlamini said starting yesterday they were planting 150 000 tomato plants, which is unprecedented in winter but they were positive to get a good yield.
He said while he is known for DNA testing, he has always been an agronomist with his first degree being crop sciences from the University of Zimbabwe.
Mr Dlamini said at UZ, he learnt that agriculture was a lucrative business as they would go on field visits to some white commercial farms for practical lessons.
 
“Most people know me as a DNA testing guy but I’m a trained agriculturalist, I’m an agronomist. My first degree is in agronomy but I specialised in genetics. I then specialised in molecular genetics which is DNA genetics. That’s what makes me fit in the lab with the molecular genetics aspect. But genetics is what I’m doing here,” said Mr Dlamini.
He said being a lecturer does not pay as much as being in the agriculture sector.
“We moved onto this farm in 2018, before I was doing it on a small scale in areas where there is no water mainly in plots in Bulawayo. Here we are in the aquifer region so there is plenty of water, it assists.
“You cannot make much money working at the lab and teaching at a university. This is why we (lecturers) are always crying and complaining but this (farming) tends to supplement one’s income and abilities to do certain things,” he said.
Mr Dlamini said farming could transform the country’s economic fortunes if it is done right.
He said serious funding is needed in farming and to kickstart the farming they had to put out their properties as collateral to get finances.
“The kind of cropping you see here; you are looking at US$100 000 investment in terms of chemicals and seed and all these things. It’s expensive and no one has US$100 000 in their back pocket. So, you have to approach banks for loans.
“But as you all know you cannot get funding from the bank using land because banks no longer accept it (land) as collateral. In our case we have title deeds to this farm but we can’t use them to farm,” he said.
“To get loans, you have to use other properties, urban properties, and this is the risk that we took. You put your main dwelling on the line but you can only do so when you believe in what you are doing. You can’t go and take US$100 000 and then you are given the money and not use it.”
He said so many people were failing on commercial farming as they use salaries to finance agricultural ventures.-@nqotshili
