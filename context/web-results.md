Hi, I'm Zodi.
I'm an early-stage investor and engineer living in San Francisco.
I spend way too much time on Wikipedia and doing flashcards. If you want to know me, drop a line or come to a homework dinner. Talk to me about terraforming, my special interests, or whatever makes you tick.
I think about this quote sometimes:
"You’d better get busy, though, buddy. The goddamn sands run out on you every time you turn around. I know what I’m talking about. You’re lucky if you get time to sneeze in this goddamn phenomenal world."
Learn more about me here.
Me, to date:

If you want to start a company today, there are over 500 accelerators to choose from.
Which one to pick depends a lot on your goals, how far along you are in ideation/company development, your age, where your based, where you are in your education, what industry you’re building in, and many other factors. These seem to be common knowledge in Silicon Valley, but before I moved out here I knew almost nothing about the differences between these.
🚀 Accelerators, Incubators, and Fellowships:
Y Combinator (YC): The epitome of startup accelerators. Since 2005, YC has been a launchpad for over 2,000 companies like Airbnb, Dropbox, and Stripe. Typical YC deal is few hundred thousand dollars for 7% equity. Beyond funding, it's the access to a valuable network of founders and mentors. Their latest batch includes a huge number of AI companies.
Neo: Accelerator + residency. Neo begins with a one-month intensive in Oregon to work on your company and build relationships with your cohort. Beyond mentorship, the typical Neo deal is $625K for 2.5% equity, plus access to Azure and OpenAI credits and leading AI researchers.They also offer a "Neo Scholar" program for college students flirting with the startup world.
Embed (Conviction): Accelerator for AI startups offering $150K investment, uncapped, no-discount MFN SAFE, $350K in Azure credits, and $250K of credits with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Baseten. Applications to join their second, highly-selective cohort of 10-15 companies opened today, and will be accepting founders on a rolling basis over the next two months.
AI Grant: Focused only on funding AI companies. AI Grant offers $250,000 on an uncapped SAFE, $350,000 in Azure credits, and $200,000 in additional credits. Founders can be based anywhere, but will have the opportunity to attend a summit in San Francisco to meet fellow founders and an impressive list of advisors with experience running AI companies.
Thiel Fellowship: This fellowship gives undergraduate students $100k to drop out of college and work on a project for two years. In many circles of tech, this is considerably more prestigious than legacy academic fellowships (like Rhodes or Marshall) mainly due to the extremely impressive alumni like Dylan Field, Laura Deming, and Vitalik Buterin. You don’t need an incorporated company to apply, but must be actively working towards something concrete.
South Park Commons: A fellowship offering a guided path through the ideation phase of starting a venture-backed company through community, mentoring, and funding. Beyond the 10 week founder curriculum, fellow receive $400k for 7% equity via SAFE, plus $600,000 in their next venture round.
HF0: Hacker Fellowship Zero is a new (first batch ran last year) 12-week residency for technical founders who have something concrete they would like to work on. Deal structure is 3% equity for half a million uncapped in funding.
